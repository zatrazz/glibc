         and 2^-126 (relative)
    (e) rounding error on p + r, bounded by 2^-117 (absolute) and 2^-126
        (relative)
     We distinguish two cases here: E<>0 and E=0.

     If E<>0, then |r_in| > 2^-0.53 and |p| < 2^-1.47, thus |r| > 2^-1.59.
     The absolute errors (b), (c1), (c2), (d1), (d2) are bounded by
     2^-137.95 + 2^-130 + 2^-136 + 2^-128 + 2^-133 < 2^-127.63, which thus
     converts to 2^-127.63/2^-1.59 < 2^-126.04 as relative error.
     Together with the relative error (a) e1=2^-126.41 on E*log(2) and
     (e) e2=2^-126 on p+r, this yields with e3=2^-126.04:
     |(1+e1)*(1+e2)*(1+e3)-1| < 2^-124.55.

     If E=0, then the rounding error (a) on E*log(2) vanishes, and likewise
     the rounding error (e) on p + r, since r=0. We further distinguish two
     cases: either i <> {127, 127}, or 127 <= i <= 128.

     If E=0 and i <> {127, 128}: the errors (a) and (e) vanish since r=0.
     Using interval arithmetic to analyze each of the possible (i,j) pairs,
     using the fact that the errors (c1) and (c2) are bounded by 1/2 ulp
     of the corresponding values, and that the errors (d1) and (d2) are
     bounded by 2 ulps of the corresponding result, we find (see routine
     max_rel_err_p2_case1 in the accompanying file dint.sage) that the
     maximal relative error is bounded by 2^-123.89, obtained for i=126
     and j=8256.

     If E=0 and (i=127 or i=128), then we have _INVERSE_2_1[i-90]=1 thus
     _LOG_INV_2_1[i-90]=0, and the errors (c1) and (d1) also vanish.
     It only remains errors (b), (c2) and (d2). We further distinguish
     two sub-cases: either j <> {8191, 8192}, or 8191 <= j <= 8192.

     If E=0, i in {127,128} and j <> {8191, 8192}, then using the same method
     as in case E=0 and i <> {127, 128}, we find that the relative error
     is bounded by 2^-122.88 (attained for j=8193). See routine
     max_rel_err_p2_case2() in the accompanying file dint.sage.

     It remains the case E=0, i in {127,128} and j in {8191, 8192}. In this
     case the errors (c2) and (d2) are also zero, it only remains error (b),
     which is bounded by 2^-124.82 (relative).

     In summary, the relative error is bounded:
     * if E<>0, by 2^-124.55
     * if E=0 and i <> {127, 128}, by 2^-123.89
     * if E=0, i in {127, 128}, j <> {8191, 8192}, by 2^-122.88
     * if E=0, i in {127, 128}, j in {8191, 8192}, by 2^-124.82

     In all cases, the relative error is bounded by 2^-122.88,
     where the largest bound comes from the case E=0, i in {127, 128},
     and j <> {8191, 8192}.

     (b) error on p_3() bounded by 2^-265.67 (absolute) and 2^-252.66 (rel)
     (c1) approximation error on _LOG_INV_3_1[i-90], bounded by 2^-258

     (c2) approximation error on _LOG_INV_3_2[j-8128], bounded by 2^-263

     (d1) rounding error on _LOG_INV_3_1[i-90] + p, bounded by 2^-256

     (d2) rounding error on _LOG_INV_3_2[j-8128] + p, bounded by 2^-261

     (e) rounding error on p + r, bounded by 2^-245 (absolute) and
         2^-254 (relative)
     We distinguish two cases here: E<>0 and E=0.

     If E<>0, then |r_in| > 0.69314 and |p| < 0.3574153, thus |r| > 0.33572.
     The absolute errors (b), (c1), (c2), (d1), (d2) are bounded by
     2^-265.67 + 2^-258 + 2^-263 + 2^-256 + 2^-261 < 2^-255.63, which thus
     converts to 2^-255.63/0.33572 < 2^-254.05 as relative error.
     Together with the relative error e1=2^-253.67 on E*log(2) and e2=2^-254
     on p+r, this yields with e3=2^-254.05:
     |(1+e1)*(1+e2)*(1+e3)-1| < 2^-252.31.

     If E=0, then the rounding error (a) on E*log(2) vanishes, and likewise
     the rounding error (e) on p + r, since r=0. We further distinguish two
     cases: either i <> {127, 127}, or 127 <= i <= 128.

     If E=0 and i <> {127, 128}: the errors (a) and (e) vanish since r=0.
     Using interval arithmetic to analyze each of the possible (i,j) pairs,
     using the fact that the errors (c1) and (c2) are bounded by 1/2 ulp
     of the corresponding values, and that the errors (d1) and (d2) are
     bounded by 2 ulps of the corresponding result, we find (see routine
     max_rel_err_p3_case1 in the accompanying file qint.sage) that the
     maximal relative error is bounded by 2^-251.88, obtained for i=126
     and j=8256.

     If E=0 and (i=127 or i=128), then we have _INVERSE_3_1[i-90]=1 thus
     _LOG_INV_3_1[i-90]=0, and the errors (c1) and (d1) also vanish.
     It only remains errors (b), (c2) and (d2). We further distinguish
     two sub-cases: either j <> {8191, 8192}, or 8191 <= j <= 8192.

     If E=0, i in {127,128} and j <> {8191, 8192}, then using the same method
     as in case E=0 and i <> {127, 128}, we find that the relative error
     is bounded by 2^-250.74 (attained for j=8193). See routine
     max_rel_err_p3_case2() in the accompanying file dint.sage.

     It remains the case E=0, i in {127,128} and j in {8191, 8192}. In this
     case the errors (c2) and (d2) are also zero, it only remains error (b),
     which is bounded by 2^-252.66 (relative).

     In summary, the relative error is bounded:
     * if E<>0, by 2^-252.31
     * if E=0 and i <> {127, 128}, by 2^-251.88
     * if E=0, i in {127, 128}, j <> {8191, 8192}, by 2^-250.74
     * if E=0, i in {127, 128}, j in {8191, 8192}, by 2^-252.66

     In all cases, the relative error is bounded by 2^-250.74
     where the largest bound comes from the case E=0, i in {127, 128},
     and j <> {8191, 8192}.

/*
  Computes x^y and returns 1 if the result fits into 54 bits, i.e. computes
  exactly x^y for exact and midpoint cases.
  Implements Algorithm detectRoundingBoundaryCase from [4].
  Requires that the relative error between x^y and the approximation z of
  x^y is less than 2^-117: z = x^y * (1 + eps) with |eps| < 2^-117.
  Can return 1 only when (x,y) are in the set S from [4]:
  (a) either y is an integer, 2 <= y <= 34, or
  (b) x=2^E*m with m odd and y = 2^F*n with -5 <= F < 0, n odd, 3 <= n <= 34
  exact is non-zero iff x^y is exactly representable in binary64.
  Note: [2] says 2 <= y <= 35 and 3 <= n <= 35, but the value 35 is not
  possible, since 3^35 has 56 bits.
