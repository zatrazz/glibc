/* Some macros can be overridden if the architecture requires some specific
   atomic operations or provides extra optimizations.

   * atomic_max (mem, value): atomically set the maximum value of *mem
     and value to *mem.  Used on malloc statistics collection.

   * atomic_full_barrier: defaults to __atomic_thread_fence (__ATOMIC_SEQ_CST)

   * atomic_read_barrier: defaults to __atomic_thread_fence (__ATOMIC_ACQUIRE)

   * atomic_write_barrier: defaults to __atomic_thread_fence (__ATOMIC_RELEASE)

   * atomic_spin_nop: arch-specific instruction used on pthread spin lock
     and adaptive mutexes to optimize spin-wait loops.
