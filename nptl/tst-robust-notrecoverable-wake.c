/* The owner of a robust mutex dies, the next owner gets EOWNERDEAD, and
   while it holds the mutex several other threads block on it.  The
   owner then unlocks without calling pthread_mutex_consistent, so the
   mutex becomes not recoverable and every waiter has to return
   ENOTRECOVERABLE.  The unlock wakes a single waiter, which acquires
   the lock with FUTEX_WAITERS set and has to wake the next one when it
   releases it again.  That release used lll_unlock, which does not wake
   anyone if FUTEX_WAITERS (bit 31) is set, so all waiters but one
   blocked forever.  */
